# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent News Video Generator (Skeleton Version)

This repository contains a **skeleton version** of a multi-agent system that:
1. Fetches top science news stories
2. Summarizes them
3. Generates a script
4. Renders a short video using the Creatomate API

---

## ðŸš§ Purpose

This code is intentionally incomplete and will be used during a **live training session**.

Each agent is partially implemented, with `TODO` markers where we will write the actual logic together.

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `venv` virtual environment
- API keys (some to be provided by Swiftrinity trainer while others need to be arranged by trainees)
